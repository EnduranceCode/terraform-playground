# Gruntwork - Introduction to Terraform

The [Gruntwork](https://www.gruntwork.io/) blog has a series of blog posts on how to define and manage infrastructure-as-code in the real world using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) that is a good starting point to learn how to use this tool.

The code written following the [Gruntwork - Introduction to Terraform](https://blog.gruntwork.io/an-introduction-to-terraform-f17df9c6d180) is stored in [`this`](./gruntwork-introduction-terraform/) folder.
